        <h3 class="brunch-orange pb20">How do you rebrand yourself, launch a new company website, and balance the rest of your client work at the same time?</h3>
        <p class="grey lg-line-sp">Easier said than done. But it starts with an intense drive to see the project through to the finish. Over the course of almost two years, our team at Brunch worked tirelessly to rebrand ourselves from JEL Creative to Brunch Digital – a new direction that we felt more accurately represented not only who we were currently, but what we wanted to be. </p>
        <p class="grey lg-line-sp">It became inevitable that creating our new brand guide ourselves would take significantly longer due to the constantly revolving door of client work. This, combined with the objectivity issues inherent in branding yourself, led us down the path of working with an independent designer, <a class="brunch-orange-link" href="http://www.colorandstory.com/" target="_blank">Christopher Scott,</a> and creative director <a class="brunch-orange-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdzajac/" target="_blank">John Zajac,</a> who gave us fresh, experienced perspectives and got us moving in the right direction.  </p>
        <p class="grey lg-line-sp">Once we had our new visual brand in order, our team had what we needed to create our new website – the first forward-facing application of the new Brunch Digital brand. </p>

        <h3>UX &amp; Structural Research</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-1 grey pt20">
        <p class="lg-line-sp">Our user experience process began with doing research on what other successful agencies and studios were doing for their own company sites. This got our wheels turning – and forced us to figure out what was more important to us: flashy visuals and interactions or a solid user experience from start to finish. The challenge was creating something that was easy for potential clients to navigate – but also resonated with our peers in the industry.</p>
        <p class="lg-line-sp">Our design team took an agile approach to the entire UX process. From the start, it was clear that our website redesign was unlike any client project. Given the constantly revolving cycle of client work, it was critical that we were able to adapt the project to our hectic schedules. </p>
        <p class="lg-line-sp">As such, our wireframe was much shorter than normal. It felt odd breaking our normal UX process, but once we settled on a sitemap, jumping into visual design so quickly allowed us to churn out various visual concepts – and subsequently iterate on the ones that felt right. This style of managing the project fit our overall goal of launching the site as soon as possible.</p>

      <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-1 grey pt20">
        <p class="lg-line-sp">I led the visual design production, which allowed the rest of our creative team to work on the behemoth task of copywriting and content development. <a class="brunch-orange-link" href="http://www.tinyishuge.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Morgan</a> provided invaluable creative direction, while <a class="brunch-orange-link" href="https://alicepackard.carbonmade.com/" target="_blank">Alice Packard</a> created various brand assets and illustrations. </p>
        <p class="lg-line-sp">I jumped constantly between Sketch and InVision, prototyping design concepts in tandem with our development team to get a better sense for page interaction and various animation directions. This proved to be extremely helpful when it came to user flow and page architecture. </p>

        <p class="lg-line-sp">After launching our site, we reconvened as a team and identified a few areas of improvement. We included more client work earlier on the home page to allow users to see our work more quickly – and articulated our case studies more succinctly, realizing that we only have so much of users’ time to make an impression. It was important that our best work was easy to locate right away, and written in a way that could be skimmed quickly. </p>
